An effects-based assessment was conducted in the ‘potato belt’ of northwestern New Brunswick in the Little River catchment. From 1999-2001, the health and performance of slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) was monitored in agricultural and forested sections of the river. In the fall of 1999 and 2000, agricultural sites had fewer young-of-the-year (YOY) sculpin than the forested region. Adult sculpin were larger in the agricultural region, but had significantly smaller gonads, and female sculpin had smaller livers, and fewer and smaller eggs than the forested region. By the fall of 2001, only female gonad size showed a difference from the forested region. These results were used to design a follow-up study designed to investigate the relative importance of environmental factors influencing sculpin responses. The second study investigated the relative influence of temperature and sediment deposition on slimy sculpin populations across 20 sites on 19 streams in forested and agricultural catchments in northwestern New Brunswick. YOY sculpin were present at all forested sites, but only at 2 of 11 agricultural sites. There were no relationships between body size or density and sediment deposition in either the agricultural or forested regions, but sculpin density decreased and median YOY size increased with increasing temperatures. The variability in density of YOY sculpin at agricultural sites suggested that additional factors beyond temperature might be contributing to responses. A secondary overall objective was to evaluate the slimy sculpin as a sentinel and indicator of site-specific conditions. Stable isotopes of muscle tissues showed little variability in isotopic signatures, and significant differences between adjacent sites. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags implanted in 112 adult sculpin showed that 75% of sculpin captured over 10 months moved less than 30m. Both isotopes and PIT tags suggested high spatial and temporal residency of slimy sculpin. This PhD project showed biological impacts on sculpin populations residing in streams influenced by non-point source agricultural stressors, and provided support for the ability of the slimy sculpin to reflect local environmental conditions.</abstract><purpose>A THESIS SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF Doctor of Philosophy In the Graduate Academic Unit of Biology</purpose><langdata>English</langdata></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>1999</begdate><enddate>2001</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><current>publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress></status><keywords><theme><themekey>aquatic toxicity</themekey><themekey>slimy sclupin</themekey><themekey>Cottus cognatus</themekey><themekey>non-point source pollution</themekey><themekey>pollution</themekey><themekey>research</themekey></theme><place><placekey>Saint John River</placekey><placekey>St. John River</placekey><placekey>St John River</placekey><placekey>New Brunswick</placekey></place></keywords></idinfo><Esri><ModDate>20071020</ModDate><ModTime>11104000</ModTime><CreaDate>20070831</CreaDate><CreaTime>13383500</CreaTime><SyncOnce>TRUE</SyncOnce><MetaID>{CDBA7759-5064-45FB-B8D9-CC4AEA53383B}</MetaID></Esri><metainfo><metd Sync="TRUE">20071020</metd><metc><cntinfo><cntaddr><address>Department of Biology, UNB</address><address>Bag Service #45111</address><addrtype>mailing address</addrtype><city>Fredericton</city><state>New Brunswick</state><postal>E3B 6E1</postal><country>Canada</country></cntaddr><cntorgp><cntorg>NB Aquatic Data Warehouse / Canadian Rivers Institute</cntorg></cntorgp><cntvoice>(506) 365-8927</cntvoice><cntfax>(506) 365-8972</cntfax><cntemail>ardw@nbnet.nb.ca</cntemail></cntinfo></metc><langmeta>English</langmeta><metstdn>FGDC Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata</metstdn></metainfo><mdDateSt Sync="TRUE">20071020</mdDateSt><distinfo><distrib><cntinfo><cntaddr><address>Department of Biology, UNB</address><address>Bag Service #45111</address><addrtype>mailing address</addrtype><city>Fredericton</city><state>New Brunswick</state><postal>E3B 6E1</postal><country>Canada</country></cntaddr><cntorgp><cntorg>NB Aquatic Data Warehouse / Canadian Rivers Institute</cntorg></cntorgp><cntvoice>(506) 365-8927</cntvoice><cntfax>(506) 365-8972</cntfax><cntemail>ardw@nbnet.nb.ca</cntemail></cntinfo></distrib><distliab>UNB statement</distliab><resdesc>None</resdesc><custom>None</custom><techpreq>None</techpreq></distinfo><distInfo><distributor><distorTran><onLineSrc><linkage Sync="TRUE">file://\\DELL-490\C$\Data_Warehouse_SJRAtlas\Metadata\SJR Samples\Reports\DW Metadata Template</linkage><protocol Sync="TRUE">Local Area Network</protocol></onLineSrc></distorTran></distributor></distInfo><dataqual><lineage><procstep><procdesc Sync="TRUE">Dataset copied.</procdesc><srcused Sync="TRUE">C:\Data_Warehouse_SJRAtlas\Metadata\DW Metadata Template</srcused><date Sync="TRUE">20070831</date><time Sync="TRUE">13303200</time></procstep><procstep><procdesc Sync="TRUE">Dataset copied.</procdesc><srcused Sync="TRUE">C:\Data_Warehouse_SJRAtlas\Metadata\DW Metadata Template</srcused><date Sync="TRUE">20070831</date><time Sync="TRUE">13383500</time></procstep></lineage></dataqual></metadata>
