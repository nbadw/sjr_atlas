    <h1>Quick tour</h1>
    
    <p>The exact features in your Web mapping application may vary.
        This is a tour of some common features in many applications.</p>
    
    <ol>
    
        <li>Start the Web mapping application from the URL you
            have been given.</li>
            
        <!--<li>Hide the title bar by clicking the <b>Show</b> link
            in the upper right corner of the window.</li>-->
            
        <li>If you have a wheel mouse, zoom in on the map by
            moving the mouse over the map and <b>scrolling the wheel</b>
            forward a few times.</li>
            
        <li><b>Pan (re-center)</b> the map a few times by clicking and
            dragging on the map. The pan function is the default
            tool, active when the application starts.</li>
            
        <li>If the <a href="UsingTheMouse.htm">Navigation</a> image
            is available, click on a corner of the image 
            (may have an arrow) to pan (re-center) the map in the
            direction of the arrow. Hold down briefly on a corner of the
            image to pan more distance. Then pan back in the opposite
            direction. Notice the map is already present in areas 
            you return to. This illustrates the caching functionality of
            the application.</li>
            
        <li>In the <a href="ToolReference.htm">Toolbar</a>,
            click the <b>Zoom In</b> tool 
            <img src="../images/zoom-in_ON.GIF" />, then click and drag
            on the map to draw a rectangle, and release the mouse button.
            The map zooms into the area of the rectangle. </li>
            
        <li>In the <a href="ToolReference.htm">Toolbar</a>,
            click the <b>Identify tool</b>
            <img src="../images/Identify_ON.gif" />. Then click in the map
            on a feature you are interested in. The 
            <a href="UsingResults.htm">Results</a> section of the Console
            displays the location coordinates where you
            clicked. If any features are found where you clicked, you will see
            a plus sign next to the Location coordinates in Results
            (if not, an "x" will appear next to the Location--try again!).</li>
            
        <li>If features are found, expand the <b>Location</b> in the <b>Results</b>
            window by clicking its plus sign. This shows the layers where
            features are found. Expand a layer to explore the features
            found. You can right-click on a feature and choose to Zoom To
            the feature. When finished, you can remove a results item by
            right-clicking with the mouse and choosing Remove. 
            </li>
            
        <li><b>Find</b> features by using one of the <b>Tasks</b> in
            the <a href="GettingStarted.htm">Console</a>. Expand
            Tasks by clicking the down-arrow on the right side of the Tasks section.
            Then if a find or search task is listed, click it and follow the
            instructions to find features on the map. Results will be
            shown in the <a href="UsingResults.htm">Results</a> section
            of the Console, similar to Identify tool. When you find features,
            highlight one or more 
            by clicking their check-boxes in Results. Then right-click
            on the layer name and choose <b>Zoom To Selected Features</b>. The map
            will zoom to the area surrounding the feature you checked.</li>
            
        <li>Display the <a href="LayersAndToc.htm">Map Contents</a>
            by clicking its down-arrow in the 
            <a href="GettingStarted.htm#Console">Console</a>.
            Map Contents
            shows the map services and layers in your map. Expand a map
            and its layers nodes in the tree view to show the contents
            of the map.</li>
            
        <li>If enabled, click the check-box next to one or more layers
            to turn the layer on or off. The map will update to reflect
            the visibility settings in Map Contents.</li>
            
        <li>Explore <a href="Default.htm">other content and tools</a> in the map. We hope
            you find this Web mapping application useful and fun!</li>
