<p>There are several ways of accessing interactive maps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click on one of the links on the Atlas’ home page</li>
    <li>Click on the Maps tab to view a list of interactive maps, their descriptions and map previews (see Map page below)</li>
    <li>Results from a Quick Search will present a list of interactive maps if appropriate (see Search section below)</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the interactive maps have the same interface (Figure 1) consisting of a title bar area, tool bar area, a collection of map interaction windows and the map window.</p>
<p>The collection of map interaction windows are to the left side of the map window. Each of these windows can be expanded/collapsed or docked/undocked using the triangle ( 	&#9650; or &#9660; ) and arrow ( &gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt; ) symbols, respectively, in the smaller window’s title bar. </p>
<p>Undocking a window moves the window into the map area so it can be moved elsewhere in the map window. </p>
<p>Windows can be resized by clicking and holding on the bottom or vertical edges of the window.</p>
<p>The order of the map interaction windows can be rearranged by right clicking on the title bar of one of the windows. A context menu appears; the window can be moved to the top or bottom or up/down one step at a time.</p>
<p>If a larger map window is desired, the collection of map interaction windows (tasks, results, etc.) can be hidden by clicking on the &#9664; symbol on the vertical bar to the left side of the map window. </p>
<p>The following provides an overview of the sections of the interactive map window: </p>
