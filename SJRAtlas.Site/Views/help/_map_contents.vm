<p>The Map Contents window is more than a legend for the map. For most maps it allows the user to turn on or off some of the layers. </p>
<p>The map contents list is presented as a nested list; clicking on a + symbol will display lower level information. For instance, the highest level in the Map Contents is Map. Clicking on its + symbol displays the individual layers or layer groups in the map. Clicking on the + symbol of a single layer will display the symbology of the layer; clicking on a layer group displays the individual layers within the group. </p>
<p>If a layer name is a light grey rather than black, this means the layer is scale dependent. That is, the layer will not display unless the map is at a scale appropriate for the displaying the layer. For instance, one would not want to view all the roads or all the streams when the map is at a scale showing the entire province.</p>
<p>The check box beside the layer indicates whether the layer is visible. Checking an unchecked box will cause the map window to refresh and make the layer visible. Clearing a checked layer box will refresh the map and the layer will no longer be visible.</p>
